# Objective-Subjective Mismatch in Migraine Treatment
## BSc Artificial Intelligence - Medical Applications and Healthcare Project
Longitudinal statistical analysis of anti-CGRP migraine treatment outcomes, investigating the mismatch between biological improvement and patient-perceived benefit. 

## Project Overview
Anti-CGRP therapies are designed to reduce migraine frequency by targeting the Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP) pathway. Clinical efficacy is evaluated using Monthly Migraine Days (MMDs).

However, improvements in migraine frequency do not always correspond to a proportional improvement in patient-perceived disease burden.

This project investigates the potential objective-subjective mismatch in treatment response using a real-world longitudinal dataset of migraine patients.

The analysis explores two main questions:

**Objective vs Subjective Response**

Does a reduction in migraine frequency correspond to improvements in patient-reported outcomes such as HIT-6?

**Determinants of Discordance**

Which baseline characteristics may explain cases where clinical improvement does not translate into perceived benefit?

### Key Results

**Longitudinal Trend in Monthly Migraine Days**

Anti-CGRP therapy shows a clear reduction in migraine frequency over time across treatment cycles.

**Objective vs Subjective Treatment Response**  
This scatter plot highlights the relationship between objective reduction in migraine days and change in patient-perceived disease buerden (HIT-6).

## Dataset
The analysis uses a longitudinal dataset of migraine patients treated with anti-CGRP therapies.

The data contains two main components.

**Baseline dataset**

Clinical and demographic information collected before treatment:
- age and gender
- migraine history
- comorbidities
- baseline disability and pain measures

**Longitudinal dataset**

Repeated measurements collected during treatment:
- Monthly Migraine Days (MMDs)
- HIT-6 (Headache Impact Test)
- MIDAS disability score
- HADS anxiety and depression scores

Patients were followed across three treatment cycles, with visits at:
Month 1 - Month 3 - Month 6 - Month 9 - Month 12

## Methods
**Longitudinal Modeling**
Treatment trajectories were analyzed using linear mixed-effects models to account for repeated measurements within patients.

Model specification:

MMDs ~ CYCLE + MONTH + (1 | SUBJECT_ID)

HIT6 ~ CYCLE + MONTH + (1 | SUBJECT_ID)

These models estimate population-level treatment effects while capturing individual variability.

**Response Definitions**

Treatment response was evaluated at the end of Cycle 1.

Objective response  
≥50 % reduction in Montlhy Migraine Days

Subjective response  
≥5-points improvement in HIT-6 score

Patients were classified into response profile, with particular focus on the discordant subgroup showing biological improvement without perceived benefit.

## Analytical Workflow
1. **Data integration**  
   Merge baseline and longitudinal datasets.

2. **Missing data handling**  
   Multiple Imputation (MICE) for baseline variables and linear interpolation for longitudinal outcomes.

3. **Longitudinal modeling**  
   Linear mixed-effects models to evaluate treatment trajectories.

4. **Response classification**  
   Identification of objective and subjective responders.

5. **Exploratory regression analysis**  
   Logistic regression to explore baseline predictors of discordance.

6. **Clinical interpretation**  
   Evaluation of the mismatch between biological response and patient-perceived benefit.

## Results and Insights
The analysis reveals important patterns.

Anti-CGRP therapy shows consistent reductions in migraine frequency across treatment cycles.

Improvements in HIT-6 scores are more heterogeneous, indicating that subjective benefit does not always follow objective improvement.

A small subgroup of patients exhibits objective improvement without subjective benefit, highlighting a clinically relevant mismatch.

Exploratory regression analysis suggests that this discordance is not explained by baseline clinical variables alone, indicating that additional psychosocial or dynamic factors may influence perceived treatment-benefit.

## Clinical Implications
These findings suggest that treatment success in migraine prevention cannot be evaluated solely through biological markers such as migraine frequency.

Patient-reported outcomes provide complementary information about disease burden and perceived beneift, highlighting the importance of integrating subjective measures into treatment evaluation.
